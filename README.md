# Movie-Recommender

This project is a content-based movie recommender system that suggests movies similar to a userâ€™s selected title. It analyzes key metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew to identify and recommend similar films.

Using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, the system converts movie descriptions into numerical vectors and measures how similar they are. When a user selects a movie, the system returns a list of top similar movies based on this similarity score.

The project is built using Python, with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data handling and machine learning. The dataset includes metadata from popular movies, typically sourced from platforms like TMDB or Kaggle.

This system provides a simple yet powerful demonstration of how machine learning and natural language processing can personalize recommendations and improve user engagement in entertainment applications.
